    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>
        CALC - Collaborative Adaptive Learning on the Cloud aims to implement an open, adaptive e-learning environment. Recent initiatives by some of the leading organisations in tertiary education have made significant progress in the realm of virtual and distance learning. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and open learning environments such as Khan Academy have emerged; how to utilise such technologies for effective learning has many unanswered research questions as well as opportunities for explorations and development.
</p>
    <p>
        We believe that creating open, collaborative environments where information/knowledge can be easily published, shared, organised by academics or teachers using a variety of methods  which  can be easily accessed and adapted for learners' needs and styles has an opportunity for wide-ranging impacts in online and blended learning environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        An initial attempt in CALC project is to evaluate the effectiveness of using concept/knowledge maps for organising and accessing learning materials.

        CALC group members include, Heba Fasuddin (PhD candidate), Ilung Pranata (Software Development), Dr. Geoff Skinner (supervisor) and Dr Rukshan Athauda (co-supervisor).
