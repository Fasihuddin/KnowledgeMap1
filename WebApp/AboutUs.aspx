    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>CALC Collaborative Adaptive Learning on the Cloud is part of a research project conducted by Dr. Geoff Skinner and Dr. Rukshan Athauda from the School of Design, Communication, and Information Technology at the University of Newcastle. The research is part of Heba Fasihuddin’s PhD studies at the University of Newcastle, supervised by Dr. Skinner and Dr. Athauda.

    <p>The purpose of the research is investigating the implementation of an open, adaptive e-learning environment. Recent initiatives by some of the leading organisations in tertiary education have made significant progress in the realm of virtual and distance learning.  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have recently emerged; however, its effectiveness on learning is still under researched. In addition these courses are built on a general base without consideration to the variety in learning level and abilities of different learners. Our research aims to build a model for an open, adaptive e-learning environment and evaluate it in terms of its functionality and effectiveness on the learning process.</p>
